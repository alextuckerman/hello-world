# hello-world
I have no idea what I'm doing. Perhaps, I am having fun.

Tuck here, I really have no clue what I'm doing. I want to learn more about computers and coding because I just found out my son has muscualar dystrophy. I am hoping to learn enough to get a job working remotely and spend more time at home with my family. Grateful student.
